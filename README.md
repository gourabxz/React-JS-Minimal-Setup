# React-JS-Minimal-Setup
A reacte JS boilerplate for setting up react js project **without** using the [Create-React-App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)

## This Project includes:

 - Minimum npm packages
 - **Web Worker** implementation with React
 - Babel and Webpack setup for **React**, **ES6** and **Web worker**

## Why use this boilerplate?
I have created this project setup for not using Create-React-App commandline, that installs too many npm packages. 
If you need minimum react js project setup that compiles react component and ES6, this project should work for you.
